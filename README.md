# BloodCoin
## For all Debts, Public and Genetic

All contracts are signed with a DNA-based cryptosystem.

This guarantees every debtor's relatives and neighbors in their genepool can be held, to some extent, responsible;

one's obligation being proportional to the amount of similarity in DNA sequences. 

Transactions are cryptographically secured by an enhanced Blockchain algorithm called the BloodChain.

A system for eugenecists and bankers alike.
